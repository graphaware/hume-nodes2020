492,US,"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.",,87,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Zerba Cellars 2008 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Sangiovese,Zerba Cellars
493,US,"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.",,87,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Insania 2009 Red (Red Mountain),Red Blend,Insania
494,US,"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.",,87,12.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,,Knapp 2011 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Chardonnay,Knapp
495,US,"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.",Battonage,87,18.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Lava Cap 2010 Battonage Chardonnay (El Dorado),Chardonnay,Lava Cap
496,Spain,"This barrel-fermented Verdejo is interesting, but it's also a bit low on acidity. It smells like pine and blowsy flowers. Creamy, soft and cuddly on the palate, this has flavors of baked apple, wood resin and banana. It finishes round and sweet. Drink now.",Collection Blanco,87,25.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Loess 2009 Collection Blanco Verdejo (Rueda),Verdejo,Loess
497,US,"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish.",Babcock Vineyard,87,30.0,California,Suisun Valley,North Coast,Virginie Boone,@vboone,MICA Cellars 2009 Babcock Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Suisun Valley),Cabernet Franc,MICA Cellars
498,US,"There are lot's of cherry, cola, sandalwood and exotic spice flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a nice crispness from the acidity.",Annabella,87,17.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,,,Michael Pozzan 2010 Annabella Pinot Noir (Carneros),Pinot Noir,Michael Pozzan
